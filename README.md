# manage-employee-crud-fullstack
  - This is a web about manage employee. The main technology for back-end is Spring-boot and for front-end is ReactJS. Main fucntions are completed from front-end to back-end.
  - In this website I used "axios" to connect between front-end and back-end. Axios is a library is used to make request to an API and get data from API, then we can do things with that data in our ReactJS application. 
# The website has 4 main function 
 - view list employees
 - create new employee
 - update a employee
 - delete a employee
 # The website is refered by JavaGuides
